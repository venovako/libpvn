# libpvn
A small portable C library with several utility functions.

(... work in progress ...)

Some functions have been adapted from those in the repository [JACSD](https://github.com/venovako/JACSD).

The library has been successfully compiled using:
| compiler | `uname` | platform |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| clang(1) | Darwin  | x86_64   |
| clang(2) | Linux   | ppc64le  |
| clang(3) | OpenBSD | x86_64   |
| gcc(4)   | Darwin  | x86_64   |
| gcc(5)   | Linux   | ppc64le  |
| gcc(6)   | Linux   | x86_64   |
| icx(7)   | Linux   | x86_64   |
| nvc(8)   | Linux   | ppc64le  |
| nvc(8)   | Linux   | x86_64   |

Recent versions of the compilers have been povided by:
